20:00 - Manila. 

Micah jabbed F5. The key responded with a hollow _thock_. 14% open rate, fifteen clicks, two unsubscribes. Two empty Strawberry Cobra bottles crinkled under his forearm as he reached for a third. He took a big swig, the cloying chemical flavoring stinging his esophagus in that familiar way, offering a slight, artificial kick. Holding the new bottle, he scanned his peeling laminate desk for a clear spot. The accumulated mess had finally crossed a threshold. With a frustrated sigh, he swept a week's worth of styrofoam and plastic haphazardly into an overflowing bin. 

The tiny fan on his desk rattled against thin plastic held together by tape, whirring like a dying wasp, doing nothing for the sweat slicking his back. Reluctantly, he cracked the window, letting air drift in and carry the city’s noise. He grimaced, peering past the iron bars and tangled wires down at the active, lively streets below. The city's layered harmonies filled his space: the passionate belts of the videoke bar, the brassy protests of jeepneys, the staccato of shouted conversations and rolling laughter. Just more things he’d have to tune out. Great.

His eyes had been carefully avoiding the crypto wallet bookmark that was once a proud fixture of his browser bar. Just thinking of clicking it was like driving an icepick deep into his gut. The only thing he could bring himself to look at right now was this blank Google Doc. Each pulse of the cursor, a tiny, blinking accusation: _wasted, wasted, wasted_. He rubbed a thumb over the sticky spacebar, then forced his hands back to the keys. Focus.

Micah was behind _Growth Spiral,_ a blog he had poured the better part of five years into. In his prime, he could churn out 2,000 word clickable hits effortlessly. Like they were nothing. SEO-optimized before the sun rose over the U.S. east coast. He remembered the glory days: “10 Prompt Hack Secrets You Need To Know To 10X Your Image Gen” had somehow racked up 5k shares, a true masterpiece. Even “12 Reasons Solana Is About To FLIP Ethereum!” had made a splash, though even he admitted it had aged poorly.

Sure, it was never the biggest tech or finance blog, but he had almost 1,600 subscribers at one point. Now he was barely clinging to five hundred. Big tech, man. They were always gatekeeping, yes. But now it felt like they were actively, deliberately, trying to bury him. Those bastards at X had even taken 40 hard earned US dollars from him for a checkmark and then continued flagging his blog posts as spam. Nobody even sees his“10 Things You Need To Know This Morning” threads anymore, no matter how many exploding head emojis he peppered in. The algo had moved on. He felt blacklisted. Probably just the Americans trying to keep all the traffic to themselves, trying to keep unique and diverse creators like Micah out.

He knew he could push through this though. Micah had a philosophy. You see, it all went back to this youtube video he watched years ago. It had this old bald guy, he was holding up this pencil and was saying a bunch of crazy shit about it. What he was saying was basically that nobody even knew how a pencil got made. It was a total mystery. Thousands of people all over the world, cutting down trees, digging up the lead, mixing the yellow paint, making the little metal bit and shit. None of them even talked to each other or knew what the fuck was gonna happen. They were doing their own hustle, chasing their own little bit of cash. And somehow, out of everyone grinding, boom, you get a pencil. Like magic.

Micah loved that. Still did, especially now. Great things weren’t made from grand plans or designs. The whole system was just a black box. And that meant that nobody could really keep him out. Not forever. He just needed to post, trade, hustle. Just a little bit harder. Eventually one of his posts, one of his angles, they would be the piece to the pencil that nobody even knew they needed. He just had to find his piece, and the money would flow.

But he didn’t know where to start now. Day had burned into night through the single, dusty window, and he was no closer to a finished post. He typed “Insane,” then deleted it. Too try-hard. His grime-coated scroll wheel resisted his fingers as he moved down through the list of available emojis. A rocket ship? No. A skull? Played out. Grinning purple devil? Definitely not.

He clicked on his 'Alpha Dogs’ Discord bookmark, his old go-to. The loading icon spun lazily for a moment before dumping him into a ghost town. One lonely post from three days ago:` `

`'$FARTCOINULTRAINSTINCCT MOON SOON BUY NOW!!!' `

complete with a string of rocket emojis. Below it, a phishing attempt with language so garbled it could pass for poetry. That was all that was left of Micah’s former favorite place on the internet. He had long tried to find some new server, but he kept being greeted by the same old shitty walled gardens with ‘anti-spam’ policies that were clearly just designed to suffocate small creators like him. The last thing he had found on discord that he had actually bothered to bookmark was almost six months old now: the first rumor about the OpenMind “BrainBlast” training run getting postponed. That was the beginning of the end, when the tech optimism crowd had started to wither away. His podcast feed was a graveyard of former AI experts now hawking sourdough starter kits, talking about Marcus Aurelius or some other old dead guys like that even meant anything now. Fucking sellouts, all of them. Why was everyone looking back now? What happened to the future?

Even Kai Veridian. Fucking Kai Veridian. His north star. The one who inspired him to start Growth Spiral. Even he had moved on. Micah must have spent hundreds of hours mainlining his podcast at 2x speed, mining Kai’s sprawling interviews and rambling theories. He’d made a ritual of listening over microwaved noodles, furiously jotting down notes for the 'podcast highlights' blog posts. One day, there was just a curt post: ‘Stepping away.’ That was it. No grand pronouncements, no farewell tour. Just gone. Went on a walkabout or something. It was like Micah had woken up one day in an icy bath, short one kidney.

He had been around long enough to see trends wax and wane before, sure. But Kai vanishing made it all feel different, much more final. It felt like all the greatest moments in this career of his were now behind him. Oh, how he longed for the Bored Ape days. Now _that_ was fun. He’d made real money flipping JPEGs and shilling Slurp Juice, chasing yield, delivering insights and tweeting alpha about the next big play. You couldn’t lose back then, because even if the trade fell through you’d still get a little check in your GCash from all the engagement.

But they had taken that away from him, that feeling of being a part of something buzzing and alive and real. The walls in his apartment breathed in sync with him, the drywall cracked and groaned as it inched closer. He looked at the pile of failed projects, the half finished books, the laptop radiating wasted heat. Was it time to ask his cousin if there was a spot at Accenture? Time to join the endless queue of headset jockeys and spend his days reading words other people wrote for him? All those sunless mornings, the aching wrists. It was just training data in the end. That’s what all this was wasn’t it? For _their_ models. Of course it was. He’d been manipulated. By _them_.

The game was rigged. Everyone out there, everyone trying to make it. They would all become just like him. Used up, discarded fodder for the machine. Someone had to warn them. Someone had to make them see.What would make these people pay some fucking attention? His eyes, raw and burning from unblinking hours fixed on the glaring white screen, finally rebelled. They stung, throbbed, and twitched until his eyelids clenched shut of their own accord. Hot tears welled behind them, and he blinked them open to a shapeless field of blueish white. The future they had all dreamed of had been snatched away.

His fingers slammed down on the keys.

## “THEY ARE HIDING THE FUTURE FROM YOU”

All caps. Maybe it was the Cobra, but the words resonated in his gut. It was something he couldn’t quite articulate until now.

He pushed himself away from the laptop, started pacing that small, worn rectangle between his desk and his bed, talking fast, breathlessly, into his phone's mic. Typing was too slow once inspiration struck. The only way to get a piece out on time was to spill it all out and let his AI assistant transcribe it, dress it up, and slap some sources on whatever he said, making it all legit.

"Look. Listen to me!" he barked, addressing the cracked phone screen like it was an arena. “You remember last year? It was just last year right? It was like an explosion! New models all the time. Bam! Every single week, some new tool, new thing. It wasn't hard to make a new, fresh guide every single day. Actually useful stuff! You could taste it, man, we were on the cusp. Right there! So close to a full change!"

He flung an arm and almost whacked the fan on his desk "The word online that these, you know, these explainers try to sell you ‘oh, training runs hit a wall,’ ‘compute’s too pricey.’ Bullshit!” He spun, words tumbling out, “Nobody knows what's happening in those closed server farms! Nobody! But I think we can make a pretty good guess. You think those scaling lines flatlined all at once? You think these billionaires got scared by old ass _trapos_ printing out emails in committee meetings? No way! So yeah, let’s say what we’re all thinking." He jabbed a finger towards the laptop.

"I think we got too close. We were about to see behind the curtain and they fucking panicked. Who paid for the 'pause'?! Who pushed GPU rationing?! Who manufactured the 'Taiwan war' panic?! Answer me! Who benefits?! It’s all a cover-up! All of it. And it goes deep. You think Kai Veridian just decided one day to walk away from everything? After years of telling us AGI was around the corner? They got to him. Had to. Someone made him an offer he couldn't refuse, or maybe they just... I don't know, maybe they showed him what was really coming. You know who this is right? It’s the elites! Yeah, the CEOs and banking globalists, it’s them! They’re the ones behind this whole lie!" He clenched his fist.

“That UBI shit? You can forget it guys. It’s not happening. Never ever ever. You get me? Those twenty dollars that you scraped and grinded for every single month for years, just handed over to those companies. It won’t get you even a tiny piece of what they have been cooking. I hope you saved those receipts. Thanks for your monthly payment!” He repeated the words in a frantic, mocking cadence, “Thank you! Thank you thank you thank you! Thanks for all your money you SUCKERRRRR!”

“Hold onto those cause it is the last thing you’ll ever hear from them. The last evidence that they ever stooped low enough to speak to us. The creators who made that shit possible!” He was breathing like a marathon runner, a bead of sweat tracing a path down his brow. "This is it! The curtain's falling! It’s over!"

His voice was hoarse, his hands were shaking, but he kept yelling at the screen.

“Now the economy is shit, your job if you even can still have one is probably just some gig contract bullshit, and you think you failed. No. No, no no no, NO. This was their _design_. They planned it. It’s a fucking rigged game. They pulled up the ladder and they are building a goddamn wall around it! Brick by fucking brick man."

"They’re turning this world into a fucking reservation, a matrix, a–hell I don’t even know anymore. Some neo-feudal communist nightmare where you are just their cattle. If you’re lucky they’ll print you some paper money and feed you slop all day. But if you don’t have the capital though, just–just forget it. Ha! Just- It’s over. You are so done. Dooooone.”

He paced, wild-eyed. His hair drooped in front of his eyes and he pushed it back impatiently.

"But I see what they are planning. I see it. I can feel it so loud it’s rattling my teeth every time there’s another brownout and every time the wifi flickers. You just gotta open your eyes, you’ll see it too. Get loud. Get angry. Don’t just sit there. Don’t just scroll. Raid their fucking data centers. It’s time to stop submitting to tyranny. Smash their fucking windows. Take the GPUs off their racks. That shit’s yours. This is your last chance to get even. Now! Before it’s too late."

Micah stopped, chest heaving, phone still clutched tight. A raw, shaky laugh escaped him. He briefly looked around the tiny, squalid room. Yeah. That was some really good shit. He quickly typed a more clickable headline above it: “WAKE UP: The Tech Cabal is Real!” adding a red siren emoji to the end, of course.

Then he hit _Post_.

Then, the silence. The familiar silence. He knew this drill. It wouldn’t be viral right out of the gate; even his biggest posts took a little bit of time to catch on. In the first ten minutes, a post that got 100 views and a post that got 10,000 views performed identically. Whatever happened would be a slow, agonizing burn. He placed his phone aside, time to be patient, he thought. Then, the ritual: fire up YouTube, find something to put on so he could go to sleep. Video essays, true crime explainers, reaction channels. He didn’t feel in the mood for any of it. After two minutes, he couldn’t fight it. He tabbed back to X. Nothing.

After ten minutes dragged by, he decided it was time for the post-upload post-mortem.There was still time, so few views, maybe the right tweak would light the fire. He scrolled, forcing himself to read with a critical eye. The title: 'WAKE UP: The Tech Cabal is Real!' Still fire, he thought. Or at least pretty good. But then... 'Pull the ladder up and build a wall around it?' What the fuck did he mean by that? The AI. It must have been the AI ghost writer, glitching. He had told it very clearly ‘write with the eloquence and wisdom of Steve Jobs times ten’ and it had done a shitty job. Cheap garbage tech. It got confused. It didn't capture Micah’s energy. Made him sound crazy. Ten minutes dragged. Out of sheer, mounting desperation, he reread it again, top to bottom. His cheeks burned. Too raw. Too much. A spectacular failure.

Micah placed his face in his hands. He briefly considered taking a walk. Going outside, clearing his head.

A faint buzz. His heart leapt. He yanked the phone out, refreshed.

Nothing. Ghost vibration. A hollow ache.

He stared at the screen, thumb hovering.Should he delete it? Post again? Pretend none of this had ever happened?

 _*Bzzt*_

His heart lurched. One comment. He tapped it, hands suddenly unsteady.

" _did this account get hacked?_ "

It was from a familiar username. A longtime follower. Micah's stomach dropped. But then. It was another notification. The red bubble showed 2.

" _how much are they paying you for this shill post_ "

He refreshed again. The number jumped to 5. Then 8. His thumb moved faster now, chasing the climbing digits. 78 notifications. 134. The comments were changing, evolving beyond his usual tech audience.

 _"mid"_

 _“banger”_

 _"finally someone said it"_

 _"feudal-communist-bullshit is crazy work"_

 _“slop”_

 _“is this true?”_

With the traction came the spam bots, like ants crowding around a discarded piece of candy.

 _“I've been following @CryptoGenius_Guru for months now and his signals are incredible! Made 300% returns in just 2 weeks.”_

He swiped past it, annoyed but also satisfied by this new sign of reach. The real notifications were still pouring in.

People in the replies were talking about potential AI regulations, but this somehow spun out into a fight about school closures during the pandemic. Someone accused Micah of being a Russian bot. Another said he was Chinese.

 _"people like you ruined the internet."_

Climate activists despaired, “ _the planet has been sold for scrap metal!”_ Anonymous accounts with marble statue profile pictures tallied up Jewish surnames in the big AI C-suites. A washed-up Marxist posted something inscrutable about the naive melancholy of acceleration. Even the guys who used to mock Micah’s threads felt vindicated by the new tone.

 _“Of course it was all a con! These tech bros are finally just admitting it.”_

Sure, interspersed were the comments calling him a " _deranged loser,_ " a " _cope-addled psycho_ ," or a string of clown emojis. But what mattered was how warm his phone felt against his palm. The rage that felt uncontrollable moments ago had softened. After months of silence, of unrequited devotion, the flood of attention thrust onto him felt like an apology, a desperate reunion. Every vibration reached deeply into him. He knew it wouldn’t last, but he gave into it unrepentantly. A sigh escaped from his lips that he hadn’t even realized he was holding in. This was the internet he loved: everyone losing their minds, jumping down each others’ throats.

Drained, but feeling fulfilled he laid up in his bed, phone still shaking with each notification. He’d just done something. He put it out there, and the world responded. It wasn’t really anything more complicated than that.

He knew that this wasn’t the end. He’d have to follow this up with more content, please the newfound audience. The grind truly never stopped. But at least it was a start. It was hope. A reminder that, no matter what else, he was still doing his part.

He was still making his part of the pencil.
