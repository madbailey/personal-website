Everyone wants to unearth "the real reasons" behind even the simplest remarks. People approach each statement as if it hides a secret agenda. It seems alluring and intellectual. You are reading between the lines. You aren't trusting the prepackaged narrative.

But this exercise is mostly noise.

If your roommate says they prefer doing dishes right after dinner because it's easier, that doesn't mean they're passive-aggressively criticizing your cleaning habits. If a friend switches to a flip phone to stay less distracted, that doesn't mean they're just craving attention. And if a newly elected president enacts tariffs to revive American manufacturing, it doesn't follow that their "real" objective is a covert plan to reshape the global monetary system.

It's an often dismissed truth: most people believe what they say about their own intentions. Of course people lie sometimes. But in almost all cases, it's a net benefit to a conversation to ignore the game of decoding secret reasoning and judge them by more concrete factors. It can feel risky to suggest this because it will make you look naive or gullible. But it's the more honest and useful way to engage.

Consider Elon Musk's recent stint in the White House. His stated goal was to make government more efficient. Within months, he'd closed USAID, ended PEPFAR, gutted NIH grants, and fired staff in critical agencies like the CDC and FDA, then he left. It probably wasn't some secret plan to derail an SEC investigation of Tesla. It seems much more likely to me that Musk simply believed everything he was saying. The government was bloated, ideologically captured, and riddled with inefficiencies imposed by a nefarious deep state. He thought he could take a quick look around, identify the waste, and hit his goal of cutting $1 trillion in spending with ease. He was grossly mistaken, but he probably wasn't lying.

This isn't apologia. When we turn a simple discussion into something about elaborate theories we dilute the discussion away from actions and towards phantoms. You can argue over what someone "secretly believes" endlessly, and it can be interesting to think about, but it is rarely valuable. The effects, not the theories, [are what people have to live with](https://www.impactcounter.com/dashboard?view=table&sort=title&order=asc).
