In the space between keystrokes, Marcus lived entire lifetimes. Each line of code was a doorway, each function a universe waiting to be born.

<InteractiveCode />

Tonight, as rain traced algorithms down his window, he worked on something different. Not a program or an app, but a digital dream—a space where data danced and pixels painted emotions across screens that had never known such beauty.

```javascript
// Example of embedded code that could control a shader
const dreamShader = {
  vertex: `
    attribute vec4 position;
    void main() {
      gl_Position = position;
    }
  `,
  fragment: `
    precision mediump float;
    uniform float time;
    uniform vec2 resolution;
    
    void main() {
      vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy;
      vec3 color = vec3(sin(time + uv.x), cos(time + uv.y), sin(time * 2.0));
      gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
    }
  `
}
```

The cursor blinked patiently as he typed the final semicolon. Somewhere in the machine's memory, a new world stirred to life, populated by creatures made of light and logic, where the laws of physics bent to the will of imagination.
