Carmen offered me a cigarette, holding it delicately between manicured fingers. I took it, even though I’d been trying to quit. The party was too loud, the air too thick, and I just needed a break.

The lights were flashing purples and blues and the floor was sticky from spilled drinks. It  was in the thick of the summer and the house was filled with bodies and the old building couldn’t shake the humidity. So we went to the backyard. The night was cool but wet, clinging.

I took the cigarette in one hand and told her this story.

When I was waiting for the train one night, I said, about a week or two ago. I saw this woman on the platform. She had on a blue lace dress, the kind you might see at a wedding reception. The hem was frayed and there was a big stain near the collar, but the lace itself was very intricate. Over it, a black shawl that was thick and fuzzy, like a bath mat. On her feet she had these old chestnut ugg boots that looked soggy. But I kept looking at her hands. Her fingernails were bitten all the way down, in a jagged nervous way. But there were still these little flecks, red dots and remnants of  some manicure she must have gotten a long time ago.

I made a quick joke about how fashion victims were common around these parts, and Carmen laughed.

But I saw something that made it all make sense. It was the stubble. On their chin. It reminded me of when I first started getting hair cropping up there, you know, before everything. Before I learned to manage it. I kept staring at it. 

It’s a shame to see someone stop trying. To let it all come back like that.

Carmen hesitated, weighing a reply. But I knew she wouldn’t, so I continued. 

I had to move, to get away from the sight of them. But the train slid into the station. Carrying with it a bright light. And it was like my eyes were chained to this person. And as it pulled in, the wind changed, and I got the smell. The smell of the street. I noticed the scarf tied up around them to try and hide a balding patchy head. That’s when it truly hit me. My stomach clenched. I boarded the car on the far side from her.

It was late at night, really late, so in our car it was just me, this homeless person and the group of five young men who were already on the train. Carmen's eyes darted around the backyard. She took a quick drag of her cigarette.

I just did what I normally do on the train. I was scrolling through Instagram, trying to zone out, when the boys voices started to cut through the whine of the tracks. At first it was just laughter. Then one of the young men said it.. 'Hey, look at it,' he said, loud enough for the whole car. My head snapped up. They’d moved closer to the person, circling.

They were ruthless. Mocking the shadow on their chin. The soggy damp outfit. One of them made a show of holding his nose. Then I heard it, sharp and clear. 'Fucking faggot.'

Carmen’s cigarette stopped halfway to her mouth. 'And you?' she asked. 'What did you do?'

Nothing, I said, the word felt small in the night air. I took a drag before continuing. There were five of them. What was I going to do? I could have just ended up provoking them or making it worse.

It felt like this went on for hours and hours. Their laughter was just stuck in my head. I tried to shrink myself, I rested my face in my hands. I saw one of them spit on the ground. But this person, the subject of all this hate, was just sitting straight up and looking forward. Like a statue. Not saying a single word or anything.

One of the boys – soft-faced, almost pretty, with a chin like a shovel – he turned his head to me, looked me directly in the eyes. He smiled, like a cat presenting a dead mouse at your feet. And without thinking, I was horrified to admit this, but I smiled back. It was like an animal instinct. To get the predator off of my trail. And then, just as soon as it started, all at once the spitting and the jeering ended. They all left the train. And after they were all gone and I was sure that they were gone I went over to her to try and offer her some comfort or some money for food or something. 

You gave them money, Carmen said. She took a long drag of her cigarette. That was very nice of you.

I shrugged. I went up to her and I asked her if she was ok. She responded simply, the lights in here hurt my teeth. When the lights get bright like this it makes my mouth hurt. 

I just put all the cash I had on me into her shaking hands. She didn’t respond. 

Carmen just looked down at her cigarette, rolling it between her fingers.

After I got back to my apartment, I shut the door and bolted it behind me. I threw my clutch on the couch and marched straight to the bathroom.

When I turned the lights on they hummed for a second. The water stained mirror showed my reflection clearly. My eyeliner was a black smear. I took the nice facial cleanser my mother got me for christmas, and I gave it three hard, forceful pumps. I started in on my face. Scrubbing. My nails scraped my face. I worked my cheeks in tiny, vicious circles. I made the same lines of punishment over and over again on my skin. I covered my face in suds until it was lost under the  white bubbles.

I twisted the tap until the water steamed. Scalding. I splashed it on myself. A shock of heat felt good. It felt right. I did it again.

When I looked up, the skin in the mirror was raw. Red and angry. I leaned in close, until my breath fogged the glass. I pulled my hair back, tight, stretching the skin over my skull. My finger traced the hairline. It felt higher. I would have to start measuring.

I didn’t tell Carmen any of that though. 

Carmen had kept silent for a while. She shoved her cigarette butt into the wall behind her.

Jesus, Carmen said, stubbing out her cigarette against the wall harder than necessary. That's so awful. She wouldn't meet my eyes. There's nothing you could really do though, right? I mean, people with mental illness need serious help. My aunt had schizophrenia. She left her husband and they found her on the street all alone in Phoenix. It's just a chemical thing, you know? Carmen shrugged, already turning back toward the house.

My cigarette, forgotten, had gone cold in my fingers. We let a moment pass, and both headed back inside the party.
