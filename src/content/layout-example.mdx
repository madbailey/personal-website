# The Art of Digital Composition

This text flows naturally on the left side of the page, creating an asymmetric layout that feels more dynamic and modern than traditional centered text.

You can write your story normally, and the text will automatically position itself about 1/3 from the left edge, leaving plenty of space for visual elements.

<div className="not-prose fixed right-16 top-32 z-10">
  <ShaderCanvas 
    fragmentShader={`
      precision mediump float;
      uniform float time;
      uniform vec2 resolution;
      
      void main() {
        vec2 uv = gl_FragCoord.xy / resolution.xy;
        
        // Flowing organic patterns
        float wave = sin(uv.x * 3.0 + time) * cos(uv.y * 2.0 + time * 0.7);
        float ripple = sin(length(uv - 0.5) * 10.0 - time * 3.0) * 0.5;
        
        vec3 color = vec3(
          0.3 + 0.3 * wave,
          0.5 + 0.3 * ripple,
          0.7 + 0.3 * sin(time + uv.x + uv.y)
        );
        
        // Soft glow effect
        float glow = 1.0 - length(uv - 0.5) * 1.5;
        color *= glow;
        
        gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 0.8);
      }
    `}
    width={320}
    height={240}
  />
</div>

The beauty of this approach is that you can position shader art exactly where you want it using Tailwind classes. The example above uses `fixed right-16 top-32` to position the shader on the right side.

## Flexible Positioning

You can also embed shaders inline with your content, or create different layouts for different sections:

<div className="not-prose my-16 ml-[60%] -mr-8">
  <ShaderCanvas 
    fragmentShader={`
      precision mediump float;
      uniform float time;
      uniform vec2 resolution;
      
      void main() {
        vec2 uv = (gl_FragCoord.xy - resolution.xy * 0.5) / resolution.y;
        
        // Simple geometric pattern
        float d = length(uv);
        float angle = atan(uv.y, uv.x);
        
        float pattern = sin(d * 8.0 - time * 2.0) * sin(angle * 6.0 + time);
        
        vec3 color = vec3(
          0.5 + 0.5 * pattern,
          0.3 + 0.4 * sin(time + d),
          0.8 - 0.3 * pattern
        );
        
        gl_FragColor = vec4(color, 1.0);
      }
    `}
    width={280}
    height={200}
  />
</div>

The key is using the `not-prose` class to escape the text flow and position elements freely. You can use:

- `fixed` positioning for elements that stay in place as you scroll
- `absolute` positioning relative to the container  
- `ml-[60%]` to push elements to the right side
- Negative margins like `-mr-8` to extend beyond the normal boundaries

## Typography That Breathes

With the text positioned asymmetrically, there's more visual interest and breathing room. The layout feels less constrained and more artistic - perfect for creative writing that incorporates interactive elements.

You can continue writing normally, and everything flows naturally while leaving space for your creative additions.
