Beth’s voice was slightly muffled by the glass display case her head was behind.

“Margaret? Do you think we’ll even recognize this world ten years from now?”

She had been straightening the compacts all morning. Nudging each one a quarter inch this way or that. Her blunt, kitchen-scissor bangs were all astray, shadowing her face.

“Ten years? I figure I’ll be standing here, same spot I was in ’43.” I tore the day-old tape off the register spool, my thumb still gritty with ink.

"But everything's changing so fast." She breathed a fog onto the spotless glass and wiped it away. "The whole world."

The smell of coffee from the Magnolia Room was stronger than usual, masking the sample spritzes of Youth Dew and Chanel No. 5. Mrs. Patterson must have made a fresh pot for the late afternoon crowd. In twenty minutes this place would be filled with murmurs and the click and clacking of heels on terrazzo, women in their good hats, touching everything and buying nothing. The arches in my feet were already aching.

Beth had been here since June. Longer than most summer girls, but she was still just a summer girl. Not someone who would last long at store-tending. She had spent the past two months talking about the strange magazines she read and how beautiful the campus was at Agnes Scott.

“You remember how I told you last week, how with television becoming more and more popular, people in the future won't have accents any longer?” Beth turned towards the mirrored column and flattened out the apron over her ten dollar Sears shirt dress. “They'll all talk the same way because the children, they'll look at the TV and they'll all see the same actors. And that's how they'll learn to talk. It’s fascinating.”

“Oh yes, right. I remember.” I finally met her gaze. “Doesn’t that sound a bit sad to you? People from all parts all talking the same way. Losing character.”

“Well, I don’t think it’s sad. It's about understanding each other, right? Simple communication. It’s already happening in some ways. The girls from my orientation at Agnes Scott, they have no drawl at all. You’d have no idea where they were from. Why, they talk just like Dinah Shore.” She paused and scrunched up her eyebrows. “Like this, Mah-ga-ret.” She giggled.

I shook my head, a grin tugging on my cheeks. “You know, when I leave here most nights, after Mister Wallace locks up, some of the colored folks who work here just idle around the window to watch those television sets. Just standing there, staring at the picture through the glass. You suppose they’ll just start talking good as us white folks, then? I don’t. People speak in their nature.”

“But at a young age, at least, people’s nature can change. I was reading this article in Life about emotional development in children. It was very interesting. It was a child psychologist and he said if you don't talk to your kids in a nice way, or don't show them a lot of different people, they can actually have fewer emotions. Imagine that.”

“So you think the TV will just become everybody’s ma and pa both?”

She laughed a little. “Maybe. You know, it’s like this story I read by Isaac Asimov. Have you ever read—”

A lady in celery-colored gloves rapped a quarter on the glass. “Price on the Dusty Rose?”

“Ninety-eight cents, ma’am.” I rang the bell, and wrapped it neatly and sent her off.

I turned to see Beth hunched over with her elbows placed firmly on the countertop, back bent over the glass.

“Beth, mind your posture behind the counter.” I murmured, not taking my eyes off the main aisle. Mr. Wallace, the plump and dandy-looking man, was out on the floor in his tweed olive suit and checkered tie, hands clasped behind his back, observing with a faint squint like a general on the battlefield.

Beth sighed, shifting on her stool. “Oh please, it’s my last day. What’s Mister Wallace going to do?”

I didn’t answer. I just kept my own back straight, feeling his gaze sweep over our section before he moved on toward Handbags.

For the next two hours people kept coming by our glass counter out in the center of the store room. I ended up helping most of these ladies, but every ten minutes or so Beth would draw her eyes up from small little tasks and help someone out. She had never quite got the knack of things. I excused myself to the bathroom for a moment, and hoped she would manage for five minutes without my supervision.

I wasn’t alone in the bathroom. Janice, from hosiery, was spending her time applying her lipstick in the mirror. That woman had been working here a decade longer than I had but spent only half as much time actually tending to the floor.

“They got you all alone with Beth huh?” Janice gave me a knowing grin. “Something isn’t quite right with that girl.”

“She’s just young,” I said, turning the squeaky handle on the faucet. I let the water run over my wrists, watching it circle the drain.

“Well she might find trouble getting a husband acting that way, you know, most boys aren’t looking for a girl who spends her time talking about rockets.” She glowered at me and raised an eyebrow. “It’s not like it’s easy to find a good man nowadays.”

The words just hung there in the air between us.

I grabbed a towel to dry my hands off. “She’s got time to figure things out”

Janice hummed skeptically as I walked back onto the floor.

Mr. Wallace was waiting for me at the counter.

“Miss Campbell, do you remember what I told you about the Magic Touch foundation?” He shook a box. “It’s almost closing hours and we haven’t sold a single one today. Are you even trying to sell this?”

“Well, I have sir. Just a few hours ago I did a demo on this lady who came here down from Buckhead. Had on a nice big hat, white gloves. A real big spender it seemed to me. And she liked it fine enough. Seemed very excited, but then she just bought the same Pond’s she always gets. A lot of people, they just like what they like. It’s strange sometimes.”

He didn’t laugh, just pressed his thumb against the label. “Maybe so, but we get young girls in here often enough who aren’t so stuck in their ways, we should be able to at least get them to try. Beth?” He turned back to the counter. “Beth, maybe you can help me with this. I need a young woman’s perspective. What do you think about the Magic Touch foundation?”

“Well, I think it’s quite nice. It’s convenient, certainly. But it’s no good for the humidity. It melts right away.” Beth thought for a second. “It might be better after the summer passes.”

Wallace’s mouth twitched, like he was chewing the words over. He rapped the box on the glass a few times. “So you’re saying it’s no good? Great.” He set the box down a little harder than necessary. “These distributors are always just trying to offload their lousy products.”

I tried to catch Beth’s eye, maybe to warn her to be more careful.

Wallace was already halfway turned away. “Well, I suppose we’ll put these back. But I need you both to push these come fall, we have to get them out the door somehow. ”

Beth hesitated, then tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “Oh. Well I won’t be here then. I’m back to Agnes Scott next week. You remember?”

He gave her a thin smile. “Ah yes. Right. The college girl. Good to see you moving on, Beth. You don’t want to end up stuck here with the rest of us.” With that, he headed off to his office.

I took a bottle of cleaner and dumped it on the glass. With my full weight I pressed this dirty old rag into the counter and rubbed the same circle over and over. The glass squeaked under my hand. I kept my head low, hoping the muzak would drown out whatever was left rattling in my chest.

Beth hovered nearby, worrying the hem of her dress. “Did he say something to upset you?”

“Nothing worth talking about,” I said, not meeting her eye.

“That’s good. You know what he said, it reminded me of this interesting story. It got me thinking about this store. Right here. How, you know with robotics it’s possible that soon no one will need to go to the store anymore. It’ll be-”

“Looks like we’re low on those Mascara Wands,” I said, a little too quickly. “I’ll get a box from the basement stock.”

I turned from the counter, leaving the bright lights and perfume behind. My cuban heeled oxfords made no sound on the plush runner leading to the grand staircase. From the landing, I could see the Crystal Bridge arching over Forsyth Street, a glass tube full of afternoon light. Inside it, shoppers seemed to float above the traffic below. It was as if the store itself couldn't be contained in one building anymore. First it had sprouted the Store for Homes across the street, then the Store for Men. Entire six-story worlds, all of them linked back to the main floor by those glass bridges. Maybe it would just keep going like that. More stores for each and every type of person and thing, on and on forever. All connected by glass bridges.

I didn't take the grand stairs. I pushed through a heavy door marked ‘STAFF’ and started down the service stairwell. The polished main floor gave way to bare, echoing concrete. With each flight down, a layer of the store peeled away. The faint music disappeared, replaced by the hum of machinery. The air grew cooler, smelling of mildew. By the time I reached the bottom, There was nothing to see but two doors under a single bare bulb. One was the stockroom. The other was a single occupant bathroom marked with a sign: COLORED.

The stockroom was quiet, the air stale with old coffee and cardboard. The schedule for next week was pinned to the wall. I ran my finger over it, tracing the days. The same forty hours as it had always been, Mr. Wallace’s heavy pen pressing my name into the grid in thick black ink. Above mine, Beth’s column was just white space.

Coming back up the main staircase, I had barely reached the second floor when I heard the yelling.

“What do you mean you don’t accept it?”

I pressed the mascara wands box to my chest and took a breath, thinking maybe if I just stayed out of sight, it might all blow over. But the voices only got sharper. There was nothing for it but to go back.

"Ma'am, I understand you, but—"

An older woman in a fox fur stole was spitting at the girl. "Don't you tell me what I understand, you little girl. I've been a customer here longer than you've even been alive. Now you're going to take this back, or I'm going to be speaking to Mister Wallace."

“I’m so sorry Miss. Beth is new here. How can I help you?”

The woman whirled around. "Your girl here is refusing to honor a return on defective merchandise. I got this perfume here. And it’s turned. It smells nothing like the sample. More like a wet dog than blackcurrant berries.”

“I was just telling her that we can’t do a return here. That’s on the third floor.”

I slipped the mascara wands behind the register and put on my calmest smile.

“Let’s start fresh, ma’am. May I see the bottle?”

She thrust it at me. The stopper was crusted; someone had stored it in direct sun. I could smell the turned aldehydes from a foot away.

"Oh my." I leaned in, as if sharing a secret. "Yes, I can see this has oxidized terribly. The heat, you know. Summer storage can be brutal." I clucked my tongue in sympathy. "Now, our exchange desk is on three, but for such a valued customer, I’ll handle this for you right here."

I turned, retrieved a fresh box from the stock drawer beneath the counter, and placed it before her with a quiet click. The woman's whole demeanor transformed as I made a show of checking the batch numbers and testing the spray.

"There we are," I said, handing her the replacement with a small bow. "Fresh as the morning dew. And please, do store it somewhere cool and dark. These summer temperatures can be murder on those delicate notes."

The woman practically purred her thanks, suddenly all smiles and gracious nods. She tucked the new bottle into her purse and trotted off to the elevator, her fox stole swaying with renewed dignity.

Beth exhaled a breath she seemed to have been holding for the entire exchange. “Sorry,” she whispered. “I should have thought to do that.”

“It’s fine,” I said, straightening the display she’d smudged. “You just have to be accommodating, especially towards anyone wearing a coat like that in June.”

Beth managed a rueful smile. “You make it look easy.”

“Comes with practice, that’s all.” I said, slotting lipsticks into their rack.

Beth leaned in, her eyes fixed on me now. The usual flightiness was gone, replaced with something quieter. “You’re smart about people, Margaret. It makes me wonder. I want to know what you think about the future. You never really say.”

I kept my hands moving, but slower. “Well, I suppose it’s not something I spend much time thinking about.”

Beth’s voice softened, almost pleading. “But you must have some idea. All this newness, right here at the counter. I’d be sorry to leave here without hearing your thoughts.”

“Well… I guess I think.” I looked down at the ground, and shifted my weight between my feet. “You know, what you said earlier about how if children aren’t around their parents they don’t develop all of their emotions. Maybe it works in the opposite way too.”

“I’m not sure I understand.” Beth blinked at me.

“It’s like a book. You know how a book will sometimes just stick in your head. You can think of whole new things. And that’s just words.” I looked up, trying to make it clearer. “Well, that’s why the printing press was such a big deal. Right? Someone could write something down, and then everyone could read it, plain as day. They could take it and add their own little piece. Stick their heads together, and discover things. Like science.”

“I suppose that is how it worked.” Beth nodded slowly, still trying to follow my sudden shift.

“Well, maybe it’ll be the same with television. But with emotions. We'll see all these emotions – so much sadness, so much happiness, so much anger. More than ever. And we’ll have it all stored and recorded. At our fingertips. All right there on the screen. And after a while of that… seeing every way to feel. Well. It’ll become ordinary. They'll become boring. The things we feel today, well they’ll be as simple as two and two is for somebody like Einstein. The worst day of your life, or the happiest, all of it will feel like nothing at all to those people in the future. To feel anything truly new, well, I guess they'll have to develop whole new emotions. Emotions we haven’t even the words for yet.”

“That’s- that’s fascinating.” Beth stared directly at me, turning the words over in her head.

“Well,” I said, my voice quiet again. “That’s my theory.” I turned the key in the display case lock and started flicking off the overheads, one by one.

“Ready to go, ladies?” Michael, the security guard, called from the main doors.

“Yes, thank you, Michael.”

As we turned to leave. I took another look at Beth. I wondered if she would remember me in ten years.
